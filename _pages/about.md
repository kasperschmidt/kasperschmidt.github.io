I’m Danish and live in Nyborg with my wife and two sons. 
I am working as a data and analysis consultant at [Næstved, Slagelse, and Ringsted hospitals (NSR)](https://www.nsrsygehuse.dk), as part of the economics and planning unit of the [hospitals administration](https://www.nsrsygehuse.dk/servicemenu/om-os/administrationen). 
At NSR I'm part of a small three-person datateam responsible for pullling data from various patient, citizen and HR databases and providing various analyses of the activity and production at NSR. 
In doing so, we support the NSR directorate, the personel at the different wards, as well as the employees of the hospital administration on a daily basis.
We have developed several systems to monitor and share the data and analysis using software like Excel, TARGIT and PowerBI.
Using AutoHotkeys we are furthermore enabling atomization of tedious work procedures for ourselves and the clinical staff. 
We also play a crucial part in regional collaborations on data access and development across national hospitals and take active 
part in improving the datalandscapes of NSR as well as the region, 
while providing the main foundation for the continued focus and development of the data-informed ledershops at NSR.
In other words - whenever the assignment involves NSR and data, we'll get involved.   

I started my position at NSR after moving back to Denmark with the family in the spring of 2021 after more than five years as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)](http://www.aip.de/en) in [Prof. Dr. Lutz Wisotzki](http://www.aip.de/Members/lwisotzki/)’s [group](http://www.aip.de/en/research/research-area-ea/research-groups-and-projects/galaxies). 

My main research as an astrophysicist is described in a few paragraphs at the [research page](https://kasperschmidt.github.io/portfolio/). 

I started working at AIP in 2015 after a bit more than three years at 
[UC Santa Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/) working with [Tommaso Treu](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~tt/Welcome.html).

I moved to UCSB after completing my PhD at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg](http://www.mpia.de/), as an [ELIXIR](http://www.iap.fr/elixir/) Marie Curie PhD Fellow under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hans-Walter Rix](http://www.mpia.de/rix). 

In spend my spare time with the family, play boardgames, listen to music, run, and enjoy scuba-diving whenever the opportunity offers itself.
