I’m Danish and live in Nyborg with my wife and two sons. 
I am working as a data and analysis consultant at [Næstved, Slagelse, and Ringsted hospitals (NSR)](https://www.facebook.com/NSRsygehuse/).
As part of the economics and planning unit of the [hospitals administration](https://www.regionsjaelland.dk/sundhed/geo/slagelsesygehus/Om-sygehuset/Ledelse-og-administration/Sider/Administrationen.aspx), I am responsible for pullling 
(patient) data from various databases and perform analyses and evaluations of these 
supporting the NSR directorate, the personel at the different wards, as well as the employees of the hospital administration.  

I started my position at NSR after moving back to Denmark with the family in the spring of 2021 after more than five years as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)](http://www.aip.de/en) in [Prof. Dr. Lutz Wisotzki](http://www.aip.de/Members/lwisotzki/)’s [group](http://www.aip.de/en/research/research-area-ea/research-groups-and-projects/galaxies). 

My main research as an astrophysicist is described in a few paragraphs at the [research page](https://kasperschmidt.github.io/portfolio/). 

I started working at AIP in 2015 after a bit more than three years at 
[UC Santa Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/) working with [Tommaso Treu](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~tt/Welcome.html).

I moved to UCSB after completing my PhD at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg](http://www.mpia.de/), as an [ELIXIR](http://www.iap.fr/elixir/) Marie Curie PhD Fellow under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hans-Walter Rix](http://www.mpia.de/rix). 

In spend my spare time with the family, play boardgames, listen to music, run, and enjoy scuba-diving whenever the opportunity offers itself.
