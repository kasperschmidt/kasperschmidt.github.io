I’m Danish and live in Nyborg with my wife and two sons. Over the summer 2021 (May-July) I was working as IT support for [Asmodee Nordics](https://asmodeenordics.com/) after moving back to Denmark with the family in April 2021. 

I moved to Asmodee after more than five years as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)](http://www.aip.de/en) in [Prof. Dr. Lutz Wisotzki](http://www.aip.de/Members/lwisotzki/)’s [group](http://www.aip.de/en/research/research-area-ea/research-groups-and-projects/galaxies). 

My main reserach as an astrophysicst is described in a few paragraphs at the [research page](https://kasperschmidt.github.io/portfolio/). 

I started working at AIP in 2015 after a bit more than three years at 
[UC Santa Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/).
I moved to UCSB after completing my PhD at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg](http://www.mpia.de/), as an [ELIXIR](http://www.iap.fr/elixir/) Marie Curie PhD Fellow under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hans-Walter Rix](http://www.mpia.de/rix). 

In spend my spare time with the family, play boardgames, listen to music, run, and enjoyed scuba-diving from time to time back when traveling was more straight forward.
