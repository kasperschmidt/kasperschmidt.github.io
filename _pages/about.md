I’m Danish and live in Nyborg with my wife and two sons. 
I am working as team coordinator for the data, registration and planning unit of the [administration](https://www.nsrsygehuse.dk/servicemenu/om-os/administrationen) 
at [Næstved, Slagelse, and Ringsted hospitals (NSR)](https://www.nsrsygehuse.dk).
I moved to this position after having been a data and analysis consultant in the same unit for at bit more than two years.

The data, registration and planning unit is responsible for, among other things, pullling data from various patient, citizen and HR databases, 
providing analyses of the activity and production at NSR, 
planing and facilitating the location of the wards at the hospital, 
ensure proper clinical registration in the available systems, 
and developing and coordinating the data business intelligence infrastructure specific to NSR. 
In doing so, we support the NSR directorate, the personel at the different wards, as well as the employees of the hospital administration on a daily basis.
We have developed several systems to monitor and share the data and analysis using software tools like Excel, TARGIT and PowerBI.
Using [AutoHotkeys](https://www.autohotkey.com) we are furthermore enabling automatization of tedious work procedures for ourselves and the clinical staff. 
We also play a crucial part in regional collaborations on data access and development across national hospitals and take active 
part in improving the datalandscapes of NSR as well as the region, 
while providing the main foundation for the continued focus and development of the data-informed lederships at NSR.
   

I started my position at NSR after moving back to Denmark with the family in the spring of 2021 after more than five years as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)](http://www.aip.de/en) in [Prof. Dr. Lutz Wisotzki](http://www.aip.de/Members/lwisotzki/)’s [group](http://www.aip.de/en/research/research-area-ea/research-groups-and-projects/galaxies). 

My main research as an astrophysicist is described in a few paragraphs at the [research page](https://kasperschmidt.github.io/portfolio/). 

I started working at AIP in 2015 after a bit more than three years at 
[UC Santa Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/) working with [Tommaso Treu](https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~tt/Welcome.html).

I moved to UCSB after completing my PhD at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg](http://www.mpia.de/), as an [ELIXIR](http://www.iap.fr/elixir/) Marie Curie PhD Fellow under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hans-Walter Rix](http://www.mpia.de/rix). 

In spend my spare time with the family, play boardgames, listen to music, run, and enjoy scuba-diving whenever the opportunity offers itself.
